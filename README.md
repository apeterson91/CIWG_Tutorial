# Univ. MI Causal Inference Working Group Tutorial : A Practical Introduction to Bayesian Causal Inference


See the html file `CIWG_Electric_Company_Tutorial.html` for a pretty version of the case study that will be walked through.

See the .Rmd file `CIWG_Electric_Company_Tutorial.Rmd` if you want to see the code that makes everything run.


This case study is heavily influenced by Chapter 19 of [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/), I highly reccomend the whole book for those who are interested.
